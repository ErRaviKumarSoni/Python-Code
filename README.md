""" Example for variables"""
#Declaring and assigning value to a variable
website = "apple.com"
print(website)
apple.com

#Changing the value of a variable
website = "apple.com"
print(website)

#assigning a new variable to website
website = "programiz.com"

print(website)
apple.com
programiz.com

#Assigning multiple values to multiple variables
a, b, c = 5, 3.2, "Hello"

print (a)
print (b)
print (c)

#If we want to assign the same value to multiple variables at once, we can do this as:
x = y = z = "same"

print (x)
print (y)
print (z)
The second program assigns the same string to all the three variables x, y and z.
